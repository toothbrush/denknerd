## Ingredients

* 3 and 1/4 cups (420g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
* 1/2 cup (60g) yellow cornmeal (we use polenta)
* 1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 Tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar
* 2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) Red Star Platinum yeast (1 standard packet)
* 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) slightly warm water
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, divided (1/4 cup melted, 1/4 cup softened to room temperature)
* olive oil for coating


## Method

1. Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in bowl.  Give
   ingredients a quick toss with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm
   water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. The warm water should be around
   90°F (32°C). Make sure it is not very hot or it will kill the
   yeast.  Stir the dough ingredients until everything begins to be
   moistened. Continuing on low speed (or remove from the bowl and
   knead by hand if you do not own a mixer), beat the dough until it
   is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl
   and falls off of the dough hook, about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is
   too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels
   too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it
   feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour.

1. Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease
   a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside,
   turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the
   oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in
   a warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size.

1. Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove
   dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside (to use
   later). Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and
   roll the dough into a large 15×12 inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of
   softened butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise per the
   photos below. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of
   dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with
   aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator (not in a warm
   place) for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce.

# Sauce (tomato)

## Ingredients

### Sauce:

* 2 Tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
* 1 small onion, grated (about 1/3 cup)
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, but recommended)
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* one 28-ounce can (794g) crushed tomatoes
* 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar

### Toppings:

* 4 cups (about 16 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup (45g) grated parmesan cheese
* optional and what I use: handful of pepperoni per pizza, 4 slices cooked and then crumbled bacon (2 per pizza)
* additional optional toppings: cooked and crumbled sausage, thinly sliced green peppers and/or onions, sliced mushrooms (add enough to suit your tastes)


## Method

1. Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt.

1. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes.

1. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar.

1. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until it’s hearty, fragrant, and thick- about 30 minutes.

1. You’ll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced.

1. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used.

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

# Finally

## Assembly

1. Assemble the pizzas: After the dough balls have risen in the
   refrigerator, they should be puffy. Keep one ball of dough in the
   refrigerator as you work with the first one. Roll it out on a
   lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch
   circle. Using your rolling pin as a guide (see photos below), place
   over a 9×2 inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the
   dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting
   inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small
   knife. Repeat with 2nd dough. Brush the top edges of the dough with
   a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen. Fill
   each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups/8 oz per pizza),
   then your toppings which I’ve listed as optional in the recipe
   ingredients. On top of those optional toppings is the sauce. Pour
   about 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) of sauce on top of each. If you do not
   like that much sauce, you can reduce to 3/4 cup (180ml) per pizza
   and have leftover sauce. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup (22g) of grated
   parmesan cheese.

1. Place the cake pans on top of a large baking sheet, which will
   catch anything potentially spilling over the sides of the
   pans. (Nothing usually does.) Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the
   crust is golden brown. Feel free to loosely cover the pizzas with
   aluminum foil after the 15 minute mark to prevent any heavy
   browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas from the oven and
   allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10
   minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. Place any
   leftover pizza in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5
   days.  Reheat leftovers in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 15-20 minutes
   or until hot.
